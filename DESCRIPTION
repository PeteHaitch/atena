Description: Package able to quantify locus-specific expression of transposable 
    elements from genome-wide high-throughput RNA sequencing data. The core of 
    this tool is based on the ERVmap pipeline (Tokuyama et al., 2018), which 
    processes reads following conservative filtering criteria to provide 
    reliable raw count data for each genomic region encompassing a transposable 
    element.
